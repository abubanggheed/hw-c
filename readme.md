This is a library of c programs made explicitly for fun and practice. People have told me not to try to learn c on a mac, because I would have to deal with buggy crashy programs. I did code this all on a mac and it was easy, since c can be written and run with a few terminal commands as the language is already built into the computer.

# Setup
None of the c files are built. To build a file, run
```
make <filename> -C<foldername>
```

then run it with
```
./<foldername>/<filename>
```
